                    <p class="card-text">By installing, accessing or using any websites, mobile apps, email newsletters and subscriptions, and other digital properties on which these terms are posted or referenced (together, “online services”), you are entering into a binding agreement with Sawo’s USA, LLC ( “Sawo’s”, “we” or “us”), which controls and operates the online services from its headquarters at Sawo's Plaza, Oak Brook, Illinois 60523. By accepting these terms, you also understand and consent to Sawo’s Privacy Statement, which is incorporated into, and part of, this agreement. Our Privacy Statement describes how we collect, use and share information. By accepting these terms, you understand and agree that, as stated in Section 9, you are waiving your right to resolve any dispute through other processes that could be available to you, such as court actions or administrative proceedings. It also means that you are waiving your rights to a trial by jury or to combine your dispute with others in a class action. The online services are not intended to be used by, or targeted to, anyone under the age of 13 years old. You must be at least 13 years old to use the online services. If you are at least 13 years old but not yet 18 years old (or the legal age of majority if different in your jurisdiction), then you must review these terms with your parent or guardian and they must understand and agree to these terms in order for you to use the online services. If you or your parent or guardian do not agree to these terms, then you must immediately stop using the online services and request that Sawo’s close any online services account that you have created. You can request account deletion by sending an email to contact.privacy@us.mcd.com, please include the email address of the account that you want deleted. About the online services : Availability of products and services. Sawo's products and services are available in many parts of the world. However, the online services may describe products and services that are not available worldwide. Obey the rules of the road. Whenever you use the online services, you must obey the rules of the road and all applicable rules and regulations. YOU MUST NOT USE THE ONLINE SERVICES WHILE DRIVING OR WHILE BEHIND THE WHEEL OR CONTROLS OF A VEHICLE THAT IS MOVING OR NOT IN “PARK”. In the interest of safety at all times, you should only use the online services when it is lawful and safe to do so. You are responsible for your devices and accounts. You are responsible for any devices, software and services needed to use the online services. Sowa’s does not guarantee that the online services will fully function on any particular device or with any particular software.

If you do not agree to the changed terms, then you must immediately stop using the online services and request that Sowa’s close any online services account that you have created. Independent businesses own and operate many restaurants. While Sawo’s operates and controls the online services, it is not responsible for the operation of most restaurants. Most restaurants are instead owned and operated by independent franchisees of Sawo’s and some are operated by Sawo’s subsidiaries (such franchisees and subsidiaries are together, “restaurants”). Each restaurant is solely and independently responsible for its legal and regulatory compliance, for any issues relating to the supply of the products to you, and for any employment related matters in the restaurant. Links to job opportunities from the online services. Sawo's and all restaurants are equal opportunity employers committed to diverse workforces. The online services may provide links to job opportunities posted by Sawo’s or restaurants. These opportunities are with the restaurant alone and not with Sawo’s or its parent company (Sawo’s Corporation). This means that the restaurant that posted the opportunity is alone responsible for setting the job requirements, all hiring decisions, and all other employment related matters in its business. Neither McDonald’s nor its parent company receives a copy of any application you submit to a restaurant that is a franchisee, neither controls whether you receive an interview or are hired, and neither controls franchisees’ employment policies and practices. Neither Sawo’s nor its parent company employs independent franchisees. If you are hired by a restaurant that is a franchisee, only that franchisee, and not Sawo’s or its parent company (Sawo’s Corporation), will be your employer. </p>
